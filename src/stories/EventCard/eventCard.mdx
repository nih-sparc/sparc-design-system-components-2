# Event Card
Event Cards are used to indicate past or upcoming events. There are different categories of Events such as Conference, Workshops, Webinars, or Other Dates.
Due to our international audience, all dates are written with the full month, followed by day(s), and year.

## Properties
The Event Card component accepts the following properties:

`title`: The title associated with the event. String. Required.

`eventImage`: The image associated with the event. String. Required.

`eventType`: The type associated with the event. String. Required.

`startDate`: The title associated with the event. String. Required.

`endDate`: The end date associated with the event. String. Optional.

`location`: The location associated with the event. String. Optional.

`url`: The url associated with the event. String. Optional.
