# Logo

## Primary Logo

The SPARC logo is the signature we use across all our communications. The logo should be instantly recognizable so consistency is important—please don’t edit, change, distort, recolor, or reconfigure it.

Please use our primary logo most of the time, especially when using it to refer to the SPARC program as a whole. Our wave glyph color may change in special circumstances, but keep the letters in white or black.

The wave may be used by itself in certain situations, such as augmenting designs of marketing/brand work (see Powerpoint template for examples), but for the most part should never be used on its own.

## Secondary Logo

Our alternate logo can be used to further separate the SPARC brand from surrounding imagery and other logos, but should be avoided in places where we need to apply the logo in small contexts to balance the overall design of the page.

The minimum size acceptable for visibility is 100 px (1.04 inch) for the width, and 44 px (0.458 inch) for the height.
