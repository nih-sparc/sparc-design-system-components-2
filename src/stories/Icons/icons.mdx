# Icons

An icon’s first job is to guide users to where they need to go. They need to be both recognizable and intuitive.

They visually express objects, actions and ideas, and also save screen real estate and enhance aesthetic appeal.

Plus, most apps and websites use icon patterns which are familiar to users.

Icons also visually break up the content, making it less intimidating. A well-formatted page, with text broken into easily accessible paragraphs and accented by icons, is easy to read and visually interesting enough to sustain the user’s attention.

## Background
<Story of={stories.Background} height='60px'>{stories.Background()}</Story>

### Code
```html
<icon-name
  width="36"
  height="36"
/>

<icon-name
  class="background"
  width="36"
  height="36"
/>
```

## No background
<Story of={stories.NoBackground} height='60px'>{stories.NoBackground()}</Story>

### Code
```html
<icon-name
  width="36"
  height="36"
/>

<icon-name
  width="36"
  height="36"
/>
```

## Social
<Story of={stories.Social} height='60px'>{stories.Social()}</Story>


### Code
```html
<twitter
  width="36"
  height="36"
  color="#8300BF"
/>

<facebook
  width="36"
  height="36"
  color="#8300BF"
/>

<linkedin
  width="36"
  height="36"
  color="#8300BF"
/>
```

## Icon buttons



```html
<el-button circle>
  <icon-name
    color="transparent #fff"
    width="36px"
    height="36px"
  />
</el-button>
```

## Keyshapes

To maintain consistent sizes for basic shapes and proportions across the icon set keyshapes are used for icons. This allows for a visual familarity and ease to view multiple icons together.

<img src={iconsKeyshape_1} alt="screenshot of four icons and their keyshapes" />

Icons should match the keyshape that best represents the icon’s metaphor

<img width="600" src={iconsKeyshape_2} alt="screenshot of two icons and their keyshapes" />

Icons should not be forced to be fully within the keyshape.

<img width="600" src={iconsKeyshape_2} alt="screenshot of two icons and their keyshapes, which have not been forced" />

## Accessibility

Where possible icons should be paired with appropriate text to provide clarity.
All icons should have aria-labels that explain what the icon does, and not what the icon looks like. i.e “Send mail” rather than “Envelope”


## Usage
